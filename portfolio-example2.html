                                The imaginative monde of Children’s are more subtle and superior than us. Their miming and perusing competency are more powerful rather any matured person. The visual observation of the entire surrounding finds its own language with the amalgamation of an infant’s flam. Whatever they visualize, it is just their own insight. Hijras, for a child it become very important what he knows rather what is seen by him.

For instance:-a child grows up with a basic knowledge that a cow has four legs ,but when he appeared to draw that animal, his paper would be dominate only by that knowing, rather what he visualized circumstantially. Hence, on the gradual growing process of a tot, his gist also transforms. For instance, observation and visualization of an object by a ten years old child is quite distinct than a five to six years infants. Here again the shoulders permission is also very imperative.  Regardless, a recent children’s workshop held at Asoknagar earned a pourpariers for me to introduce with various art practices of children’s from various age group.

                                The workshop was a beautiful combinatory of line, color and forms with various contents from everyday life. Sometimes the affairs are also dominated by the little artists own imaginative world. For example:-an angel, common lifestyle of everyday, ice cream parlor, panipuri, barbershop, cake shop, market places are in dominance. Three paintings are genuinely capable for drawing the attention of a spectator regarding their content, .like-storm, procession of ants at the reading table, and scribbling with monochromic painting as an story telling format. In the painting 'storm' girls fluttering hairs, turnover umbrella, are stand as a witness of the keen observation of a child.  Apart that the overall color pallets are dominated with the different hues of red, green, blue, black, orange. With less anatomical detailing and more observation ability. Hence, in some of the paintings color remains as a symbolical representation of an infant’s subconscious mind. .Regarding this statement, a painting showing an abstract form of color with vibretive orange and green is in domain. Overall it's really a beautiful turnover journey for me through those children’s to mine.
